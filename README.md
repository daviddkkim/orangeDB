# OrangeDB

**Intro**
Hi, my name is David. I'm a product designer curious about developer experinece. I'm embarking on this journey of creating OrangeDB mainly as a means to learn more about database and to build better taste for developer experience. If you have similar interests, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:daviddongkyunkim@gmail.com) or [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/dvddkkim)!


**Goals**
Make it dead simple to build off-line tools like Notes app, Todo App, .. etc. 

From my time building tools, I've noticed that here are a few things that make building web/desktop apps really simple when using React as the frontend

- [ ] Every query live updates. No need to worry about fetching after writing or handling fail cases with optimistic updates ,.. etc.

- [ ] Schemas defined programmatically so that I can evolve the schema as I go and also get type-safety.

- [ ] Querys as javascript functions.

- [ ] Easy search
